# Study Queue

Keep this list updated after each discussion. Capture what to learn, why, and suggested resources.

## How to use
- Append new items at the top under "Open".
- Move items to "Done" once completed; keep a short note of what you learned.
- Keep bullets concise but specific (topic + angle + resource if known).

## Open
- Trie (Prefix Tree) Basics: Learn structure and insertion/search for prefix problems (Context: Longest Common Prefix).
- Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm: Understand the visualization of "canceling out" votes (Context: Majority Element).
- Cyclic Sort / Negative Marking: Learn the pattern for O(n) time O(1) space range-based array problems (Context: Find Missing/Disappeared/Duplicate numbers).

## In Progress
- (add items you are actively studying)

## Done
