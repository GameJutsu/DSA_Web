# Problem Addition Instructions

When you say "Add this problem" or "Add this problem as mentioned in the instructions.md", follow this exact flow:

1) Read the provided code snippet and describe the current solution in plain English. Keep it compact but thorough—mention all important steps, conditions, data structures, and edge-handling. Do not leave out key logic.
2) Provide a better or more popular approach in plain English at the same verbosity level, also compact but thorough. Explain the algorithm and any critical details (choices, complexity, edge cases).
3) Identify any new algorithms or patterns encountered that should be added to `study-queue.md`.
4) Show these descriptions to you for confirmation. Do not modify repo files yet.
5) After you approve, add the entry to the repository (update `data/solved.json`) and update `study-queue.md` if applicable.

Always ensure the explanations are complete, clear, and exhaustive while staying concise.
